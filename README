Heat template for deploying MariaDB/Galera with the following:
- 1 salt-master instance
- 1 haproxy instance w/ salt-minion
- 1 MariaDB/Galera bootstrap node with salt-minion
- n MariaDB/Galera Nodes that replicate accross the cluster with salt-minion, where n is an even number.

Still need to work on a healthcheck for MariaDB
Need to clean up inputs to template and add input for choosing flavors.
- Possibly allow choice of flavor for each type of minion

Overview
=================

This heat template deploys a salt stack on the cloud, then deploys a MariaDB/Galera cluster. It utilizes heat SoftareDeployment and SoftwareConfig resources to load pillars, install salt, download the MariaDB/Galera salt states, and run the orchestration runner.

Requirements
=================

It requires an image with the heat software config element built into it. You can find the image here:

The minimum number of nodes required for this stack is five. Make sure your cloud resources and quota limits can support 5 VMS, 1 Neutron Network, 1 Neutron Router, 1 Nova key pair, and 2 floating ip addresses.
