Heat template for deploying MariaDB/Galera with the following:
- 1 salt-master instance
- 1 haproxy instance w/ salt-minion
- 1 MariaDB/Galera bootstrap node with salt-minion
- n MariaDB/Galera Nodes that replicate accross the cluster with salt-minion, where n is an even number.

Still need to work on a healthcheck for MariaDB
Need to clean up inputs to template and add input for choosing flavors.
- Possibly allow choice of flavor for each type of minion

Need to have heat randomly generate the passwords for mysql admin and ubuntu mantenance user.
